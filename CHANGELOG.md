- **Sprite sheets:** pack sprites and frames into a PNG plus a JSON atlas
- **Notebook:** ideas, to-dos, design docs and bug lists with clickable checklists, folders and pins
- **Task Board:** Jira-style sprints and backlog with editable columns; finished issues are archived off the board
  but stay searchable; issue notes live in the Notebook

### Everything else
- Projects keep each game's assets separate; export/import a whole project as one JSON file
- Any asset can link to any other, and the project page lists everything with its links
- Saves in the browser by default; optional sign-in (GitHub or email link) syncs to the cloud and moves
  browser projects into the account
- Optional saving to a folder on your computer (Chrome/Edge) for self-hosting
- Hand-made example assets in every tool to start from
- Undo/redo in every tool (Ctrl/⌘+Z, Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y) with toolbar buttons
- Listening volume for Music and SFX (exports are unaffected); zoom in the music piano roll
- Autosave in every tool; "Pip's Quest" example assets that can be added or removed per tool
- Each tool has its own colour; phone layouts for every tool
